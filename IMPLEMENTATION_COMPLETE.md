## 🚀 How to Use Your App

### For Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - See `ENV_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
   - Get OnchainKit API key
   - Deploy contract and get address

3. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test the features:**
   - Connect wallet
   - Create a piggybank (deposits bond)
   - Record infractions (updates pot)
   - View real blockchain data

### For Production Deployment

1. **Deploy contract to Base Mainnet**
2. **Set environment variables in Vercel**
3. **Deploy app** (it's already configured!)
4. **Test on production**

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## 💡 What Works Now

### ✅ Fully Functional

- **Wallet Connection** → Real Coinbase Smart Wallet
- **Create Piggybank** → Deposits bond to contract
- **View Balance** → Real-time contract data
- **Record Infractions** → Updates local state (ready for penalty application)
- **Settlement** → UI ready (contract integration prepared)

### 🔄 Ready for Enhancement

- **Penalty Application** → Uncomment code in `piggydetail.tsx` to apply penalties onchain
- **Multi-Piggybank** → Each piggybank could have its own contract instance
- **Member Management** → Add real wallet addresses for members
- **Backend Integration** → Connect to your existing backend API
- **Notifications** → Add push notifications for infractions

## 📊 Contract Integration Details

### Current Functions Used

| Function | Status | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `depositBond()` | ✅ Active | Called when creating piggybank |
| `getBond()` | ✅ Active | Displays user's bond balance |
| `getPotBalance()` | ✅ Active | Shows total pot |
| `withdrawBond()` | 🔄 Ready | For users leaving |
| `applyPenalty()` | 🔄 Ready | Code commented, ready to enable |
| `withdrawPot()` | 🔄 Ready | For settlement |

### To Enable Full Blockchain Penalties

In `app/layout/piggydetail.tsx`, uncomment line 55:
```typescript
// Uncomment this to apply penalties onchain:
await applyPenalty(memberAddress as `0x${string}`, penaltyEth.toString());
```

**Note:** You'll need member wallet addresses for this to work.

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements Made

1. **Loading States**
   - "Creating..." button text
   - "Depositing bond..." status
   - Disabled buttons during transactions

2. **Transaction Feedback**
   - Success messages
   - Error messages with details
   - Transaction status updates

3. **Real Data Display**
   - Live pot balance from contract
   - User bond balance
   - ETH amounts formatted correctly

4. **Wallet Integration**
   - Beautiful OnchainKit wallet dropdown
   - Address display
   - Balance display
   - Easy disconnect

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### ✅ Already Implemented

- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No private keys in code
- OnchainKit secure wallet connection
- Contract ownable pattern
- Reentrancy protection in contract

### 📝 Production Recommendations

1. **Multi-sig for Contract Owner**
   - Use a multi-sig wallet as contract owner
   - Prevents single point of failure

2. **Testing**
   - Test thoroughly on Base Sepolia first
   - Run all flows before mainnet

3. **Gas Management**
   - Monitor gas costs
   - Consider gas sponsorship for users

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to prevent spam
   - Especially for penalty application

---

## 📈 Next Steps for Production

### Immediate (Required)

1. ✅ Get OnchainKit API key
2. ✅ Deploy contract to Base Sepolia
3. ✅ Set environment variables
4. ✅ Test locally
5. ✅ Create actual app images (replace placeholders)
6. ✅ Complete account association
7. ✅ Deploy to Vercel

### Short-term (Recommended)

1. 🔄 Add member wallet addresses
2. 🔄 Enable onchain penalty application
3. 🔄 Implement settlement flow
4. 🔄 Add more error handling
5. 🔄 Add analytics/tracking
6. 🔄 Write tests

### Long-term (Nice to Have)

1. 💡 Backend API integration
2. 💡 Push notifications
3. 💡 Social features (Farcaster integration)
4. 💡 Leaderboards across piggybanks
5. 💡 NFT achievements
6. 💡 Token rewards

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Members need wallet addresses**
   - Currently using mock member data
   - In production, invite members by wallet address

2. **Penalty application commented out**
   - Ready to enable when you have member addresses
   - See line 55 in `piggydetail.tsx`

3. **Settlement needs contract owner**
   - Only contract owner can withdraw pot
   - Need to implement multi-sig or governance

4. **Backend not integrated**
   - Currently using local state
   - Backend hooks exist but not connected

## 🎓 Code Examples

### Creating a Piggybank

```typescript
// User clicks "Create & Deposit"
// 1. Deposits bond to contract
await depositBond(entry.toString());

// 2. Creates local piggybank data
const piggy = {
  name, theme, rules, members,
  potEth: entry, // Initial deposit
  entryStakeEth: entry
};

// 3. Updates UI
onCreate(piggy);
```

### Recording an Infraction

```typescript
// User records infraction
// 1. Apply penalty onchain (when enabled)
await applyPenalty(memberAddress, penaltyEth);

// 2. Update local state
const updated = {
  ...piggy,
  potEth: potEth + penaltyEth,
  infractions: [newInfraction, ...infractions]
};

// 3. Refetch contract state
await refetchPot();
```
