> **1. Onchain Stakes** - Everyone deposits real money (ETH) into a smart contract on Base
>
> **2. Social Rules** - Your group sets the rules: No cursing, post 3x per week, whatever keeps you accountable
>
> **3. AI Enforcement** - Our Farcaster monitoring agent automatically detects violations and applies penalties
>
> Break a rule? Money goes from your bond into the pot.
> Stay disciplined? Win the entire pot at the end."

## 📊 DEMO DATA SUGGESTIONS

- **Violations**: Show 1-2 detected violations
- **Pot**: Show growth from penalties ($40 → $46)
