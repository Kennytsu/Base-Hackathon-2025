# Piggyfi - Hackathon Video Script

**Duration:** 1:30 - 2:00 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording + voiceover

---

## 🎬 Video Structure

### [0:00 - 0:15] INTRODUCTION (15 seconds)

**Visual:** Show Piggyfi homepage with logo and hero section

**Script:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is Piggyfi - a decentralized accountability savings app built on Base. Piggyfi helps groups save money together with real consequences for breaking commitments."

---

### [0:15 - 0:35] PROBLEM STATEMENT (20 seconds)

**Visual:** Show traditional piggy bank image or simple text slide

**Script:**
> "The problem? Traditional savings groups have no real enforcement. Someone says they'll save or follow rules, but there's no accountability. People break commitments without consequences, and the group falls apart."

---

### [0:35 - 1:00] SOLUTION (25 seconds)

**Visual:** Show architecture diagram or animated flow

**Script:**
> "Piggyfi solves this with blockchain technology on Base. When you create a piggybank, everyone deposits a stake in ETH. We set rules together - like 'no swearing' or 'post 3 times per week'. Break a rule? Your stake automatically goes into the group pot. It's savings meets social accountability, all onchain."

---

### [1:00 - 1:30] DEMO (30 seconds)

**Visual:** Screen recording of the app

**Actions to show:**
1. Connect wallet (3 seconds)
2. Click "Create Piggybank" (2 seconds)
3. Type `@username` to add member via Farcaster (5 seconds)
   - Show profile pic and wallet appearing
4. Add a rule: "No swearing, 0.01 ETH penalty" (5 seconds)
5. Deposit entry stake (5 seconds)
6. Show piggybank dashboard with leaderboard (5 seconds)
7. Show invite link being copied (3 seconds)
8. Quick view of pending violations section (2 seconds)

**Script:**
> "Let me show you how it works. First, I connect my wallet using OnchainKit. I create a piggybank and add members by typing their Farcaster username - it automatically fetches their wallet and profile picture. I set a rule: 'No swearing, 0.01 ETH penalty.' Then I deposit my entry stake, which locks my ETH in the Base smart contract. My friends get an invite link, sign in with Farcaster, and join. Now we're all accountable - break a rule, lose your stake to the pot."

---

### [1:30 - 1:50] ARCHITECTURE (20 seconds)

**Visual:** Show architecture diagram or code editor briefly

**Script:**
> "The tech stack: Solidity smart contracts deployed on Base Sepolia handle all the money - deposits, penalties, pot distribution. The frontend uses Next.js with OnchainKit for wallet integration and Wagmi for blockchain interactions. We integrate Farcaster's social graph through Neynar's API to auto-fetch user profiles and monitor posts for violations. Everything is onchain, transparent, and trustless."

---

### [1:50 - 2:05] CLOSING (15 seconds)

**Visual:** Show live Vercel URL and GitHub repo

**Script:**
> "Piggyfi makes savings accountable, social, and fun. It's live on Base Sepolia testnet. Try it at [your-vercel-url]. All code is open source on GitHub. Thanks for watching, and good luck to all the Base hackathon participants!"

## 📝 Alternative: Shorter Version (1:00 min)

If you need to keep it to exactly 1 minute:

**[0:00-0:10] Quick Intro**
> "Piggyfi - decentralized accountability savings on Base. Put your money where your mouth is."

**[0:10-0:20] Problem**
> "Savings groups fail because there's no enforcement. No consequences for breaking commitments."

**[0:35-0:55] Demo**
