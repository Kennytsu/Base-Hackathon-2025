## 🚀 Next Steps for YOU

Your app is deployed to Vercel, but **won't fully work yet** because it needs configuration:

### Step 1: Read the Setup Instructions
**Open and follow: `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

This will guide you through:
1. Getting your OnchainKit API key (5 minutes)
2. Deploying your contract (5 minutes)
3. Setting up environment variables (2 minutes)
4. Testing locally (10 minutes)

### Step 2: Test Locally FIRST
```bash
# After following setup instructions
npm run dev
```

Test everything works before deploying to production!

### Step 3: Configure Vercel
Once local testing works:
1. Add environment variables to Vercel
2. Turn off Vercel Authentication
3. Redeploy

### Step 4: Complete Base Integration
1. Get account association credentials
2. Update minikit.config.ts
3. Test at base.dev/preview
4. Publish!
