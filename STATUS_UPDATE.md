## ✅ What's Working

### **Deployment**
- ✅ **Frontend**: Live on Vercel at `https://base-hackathon-2025-ten.vercel.app`
- ✅ **Backend**: Live on Railway at `https://base-hackathon-2025-production.up.railway.app`

- ✅ **Base Mini App Manifest**: Configured and validated

### **Core Features**
- ✅ Create piggybanks with custom rules
- ✅ Invite members via shareable codes
- ✅ Join piggybanks with bond deposits
- ✅ Farcaster integration for user profiles
- ✅ View piggybank details, members, and rules
- ✅ Pot withdrawal to winner (implemented)
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket notifications

---

## 🔧 Just Fixed

### **Backend Connection Issue** (Completed: Oct 24, ~2 AM)
- **Problem**: Frontend couldn't communicate with backend for AI monitoring
- **Fix**: Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` environment variable to Vercel
- **Status**: Deployment triggered, waiting for Vercel to rebuild (~2-3 minutes)
- **Value Set**: `https://base-hackathon-2025-production.up.railway.app`

## ⚠️ Needs Testing (Critical - Do This First!)

### **AI Agent Violation Detection**
The AI monitoring was not working because the frontend didn't know where the backend was. This is now fixed, but **needs testing**.

#### **Test Steps (15 minutes):**

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment to complete**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
   - Wait for green "✓ Ready" status
   - **ETA**: Should be ready by now (deployed ~10 min ago)

2. **Create a test piggybank**
   - Go to: `https://base-hackathon-2025-ten.vercel.app`
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
   - Create piggybank with:
     - Name: `Test AI Monitor`
     - Entry stake: `0.001 ETH`
     - **Load your Farcaster profile** (enter username + click "Load")
     - Add a rule: "Don't say: test"
   - Click "Create Piggybank" and deposit stake

3. **Verify backend registration**
   - In Network tab, look for POST request to:
     - `https://base-hackathon-2025-production.up.railway.app/groups`
   - **Should see**: Status 200 OK
   - **If you DON'T see this**: Backend connection still broken (tell me!)

4. **Test violation detection**
   - Go to Farcaster (Warpcast)
   - Post a cast with word "test" (e.g., "This is a test")
   - **Wait 60 seconds** (backend checks every 30s)
   - Refresh your piggybank page
   - **Expected**: Violation appears in "Infractions" section

5. **Report results**
   - ✅ If violations appear: **AI agent is working!**
   - ❌ If no violations after 2 minutes: **Needs more debugging**

## 🎯 Next Steps for Demo/Submission

### **High Priority (Before Demo)**
1. ✅ **Test AI monitoring** (see above)
2. ⏳ **Record demo video** (script available in `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`)
3. ⏳ **Submit to Base Build** 
   - URL: Your Vercel domain
   - Manifest: `/.well-known/farcaster.json`
4. ⏳ **Test pot withdrawal** (settle piggybank + verify winner gets funds)

### **Optional Improvements**
- Add loading states for better UX
- Add error messages for failed transactions
- Add more example rules/templates
- Improve mobile responsive design
- Add analytics/tracking

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Minor Issues**
- First-time wallet connection can be slow
- WebSocket occasionally disconnects (auto-reconnects)
- Image uploads not implemented (using placeholders)

### **Edge Cases**
- If Farcaster user has no recent posts, monitoring finds nothing
- If member has no FID, they're skipped by AI monitoring
- Pot withdrawal requires owner to manually trigger (not automatic)

## 🚨 If AI Monitoring Still Doesn't Work

### **Debug Steps:**

1. **Check Railway logs**
   ```bash
   # Go to Railway dashboard → Logs
   # Look for:
   "🚀 Piggyfi backend running on port 8080"
   "🔍 Monitoring group: Test AI Monitor"
   "📝 @username: X new casts"
   "⚠️ Found 1 violations!"
   ```

2. **Check if group was registered**
   ```bash
   curl https://base-hackathon-2025-production.up.railway.app/groups/YOUR_GROUP_ID
   # Replace YOUR_GROUP_ID with actual piggybank ID
   ```

3. **Check Neynar API key on Railway**
   - Go to Railway dashboard → Variables
   - Verify `NEYNAR_API_KEY` is set
   - Value: `CC2E9B41-19DF-44D8-B672-F3E7E2CBFEA6`

4. **Manual monitoring trigger**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://base-hackathon-2025-production.up.railway.app/groups/YOUR_GROUP_ID/check
   # Forces immediate check instead of waiting 30s
   ```
