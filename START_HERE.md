- `wagmi` - React hooks for Ethereum
- `viem` - TypeScript Ethereum library
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

**YOU NEED TO DO THIS:**

1. **Get OnchainKit API Key:**
   - Go to https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
   - Create account and project
   - Copy API key

2. **Deploy Your Contract:**

   echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key" > .env
   
   # Deploy contract
   npm run deploy:sepolia
   
   # Copy the deployed contract address
   ```

3. **Create `.env.local` file:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```
